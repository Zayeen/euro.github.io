            <p>We are currently living in the era of "Command & Control" smart homes. You bark an order at a speaker, or tap a button on a screen. But the future is different. The future is Ambient Computing—technology that fades into the background, anticipating your needs without you ever asking.</p>

            <h2>Context Awareness</h2>
            <p>Ambient computing relies on context. It's not just about motion sensors; it's about presence detection, humidity sensing, ambient light levels, and predictive algorithms. The house knows you are reading because the TV is off and your heart rate has slowed, so it adjusts the lighting to the perfect warm hue.</p>

            <h2>The Death of the Screen</h2>
            <p>Screens are demanding. They require your full attention. Ambient tech communicates through more subtle cues: a gentle change in light color to signal rain, a soft haptic vibration in your wearable to indicate a message, or a directional sound to guide your attention.</p>

            <h2>Privacy in an Invisible World</h2>
            <p>When technology becomes invisible, surveillance becomes harder to detect. If your walls are listening and your lights are watching, where is the sanctuary?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passive Sensors:</strong> We advocate for the use of passive sensors (mmWave radar) over optical cameras in private spaces. These can detect falls or presence without recording a visual image.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimalism:</strong> Systems should only collect the data absolutely necessary for the function, and discard it immediately after processing.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The best technology is the kind you don't see. It supports your life without dominating it. But as we weave intelligence into the fabric of our homes, we must ensure we are not weaving a digital cage.</p>
