            <p>The IoT revolution isn't just about convenience; it's about resilience. As extreme weather events strain aging power grids, the smart home is evolving into a self-sufficient energy fortress. The integration of smart panels, solar arrays, and home battery storage is redefining energy independence.</p>

            <h2>The Smart Electrical Panel</h2>
            <p>The humble breaker box has remained unchanged for decades. Now, smart panels like those from Span or Leviton allow you to monitor energy consumption at the circuit level. Using your phone, you can shed load remotely—turning off the AC or the pool pump to extend your battery runtime during an outage.</p>

            <h2>Grid Interactivity (V2G & V2H)</h2>
            <p>Electric vehicles are essentially giant batteries on wheels. With Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) technology, your car can power your house for days. Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) takes it a step further, allowing you to sell excess energy back to the utility company during peak hours, stabilizing the grid and earning credits.</p>

            <h2>Cybersecurity Risks in Energy</h2>
            <p>With great power comes great vulnerability. A hacked smart grid could allow bad actors to cut power to thousands of homes or cause physical damage to infrastructure. Security protocols for energy devices must be as rigorous as those for banking systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Air-Gapped Systems:</strong> Critical control systems should be isolated from the public internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Strict multi-factor authentication for any remote access to energy management systems.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The future home is a microgrid. It generates, stores, and manages its own power, communicating intelligently with the wider network only when necessary.</p>
