# Zayeen's IoT Log
> **IoT • Security • Experiments**

Welcome to my digital garden. This is where I document my journey into the messy, fascinating world of the Internet of Things, smart home security, and the code that connects it all.

## 🌐 Exploring the Connected World

I believe the future is connected, but it needs to be secure, private, and actually useful. My blog explores:

*   **Smart Home Labs:** Real-world experiments with Home Assistant, Zigbee, and Matter.
*   **Security First:** How to lock down your network when your fridge has an IP address.
*   **Code & Scripting:** Python scripts, automations, and hacks to make devices do things they weren't designed to do.
