    <h1>About The IoT Lab</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to The IoT Lab. This is a digital playground where we break things so you don't have to.</p>
    
    <p>The Internet of Things is messy. It's a fragmented world of different protocols, insecure devices, and brilliant possibilities. Here, we document the experiments, the failures, and the successes in building a truly smart, secure home.</p>
    
    <h2>What We Explore</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Home Labs:</strong> Running Home Assistant, Node-RED, and custom Zigbee networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> VLANs, firewalls, and keeping "smart" fridges away from banking data.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Teardowns, flashing custom firmware (ESPHome/Tasmota), and soldering iron accidents.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>The Philosophy</h2>
    
    <p>We believe technology should be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local First:</strong> Cloud-free whenever possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Private:</strong> Your data stays in your house.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> If you can't hack it, you don't own it.</li>
    </ul>
