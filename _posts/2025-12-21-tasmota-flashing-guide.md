## Flashing Tasmota on Generic Smart Plugs

Don't trust the cloud...

### The Context
As smart homes evolve, the complexity of managing devices increases.


The power consumption analysis revealed interesting data. The sleep current was approximately 15uA, which aligns with the datasheet specifications.

The cost per unit is slightly higher, but the reliability justifies the investment for critical infrastructure like leak sensors.

We ran a stress test with 50 concurrent connections. The CPU usage on the controller never exceeded 15%, proving the efficiency of the code.

However, range can be an issue. We had to add two router nodes to cover the basement and the garage effectively.

### The Technical Details
In this experiment, we set out to solve a specific problem in the lab.

1.  **Analysis:** We started by analyzing the traffic patterns and power consumption.
2.  **Implementation:** Using open-source tools, we built a solution that runs locally.
3.  **Testing:** We stress-tested the setup for 7 days.

We compared this with a cloud-based alternative. The local solution was 200% faster and worked even when the internet was disconnected.

However, range can be an issue. We had to add two router nodes to cover the basement and the garage effectively.

Integration with Home Assistant was seamless via MQTT. The auto-discovery feature saved us hours of manual configuration.

Future improvements will include migrating to the new V2 API which offers better type safety.


### Final Thoughts
This setup has improved stability significantly. If you are building a similar system, I highly recommend focusing on local control first.
