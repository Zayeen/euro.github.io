## The Privacy Risks of Cloud Cameras

Who is watching your footage?

### The Context
As smart homes evolve, the complexity of managing devices increases.


The power consumption analysis revealed interesting data. The sleep current was approximately 15uA, which aligns with the datasheet specifications.

Data privacy is paramount. All logs are stored locally on an SSD and rotated every 7 days.

One of the key advantages we found was latency. In high-congestion environments, the protocol managed to maintain sub-50ms response times.

The cost per unit is slightly higher, but the reliability justifies the investment for critical infrastructure like leak sensors.

We compared this with a cloud-based alternative. The local solution was 200% faster and worked even when the internet was disconnected.

However, range can be an issue. We had to add two router nodes to cover the basement and the garage effectively.

Integration with Home Assistant was seamless via MQTT. The auto-discovery feature saved us hours of manual configuration.

We ran a stress test with 50 concurrent connections. The CPU usage on the controller never exceeded 15%, proving the efficiency of the code.

Security is another major factor. By isolating these devices on a separate VLAN, we ensure that compromised firmware cannot pivot to the main network.

However, range can be an issue. We had to add two router nodes to cover the basement and the garage effectively.

Future improvements will include migrating to the new V2 API which offers better type safety.


### The Technical Details
In this experiment, we set out to solve a specific problem in the lab.

1.  **Analysis:** We started by analyzing the traffic patterns and power consumption.
2.  **Implementation:** Using open-source tools, we built a solution that runs locally.
3.  **Testing:** We stress-tested the setup for 7 days.

### Final Thoughts
This setup has improved stability significantly. If you are building a similar system, I highly recommend focusing on local control first.
