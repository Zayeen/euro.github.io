### Status: Automated 🚀

This post is a "Time Capsule" created to test the new **GitHub Actions** pipeline.

In **The IoT Lab**, we don't just build hardware; we build the pipelines that power the future. This experiment proves that we can now write content in advance and trust the "factory" to deliver it on time.

**Technical Specs of this experiment:**
*   **Trigger:** GitHub Actions (Cron Schedule)
*   **Build Environment:** Ubuntu Latest (Docker Container)
*   **Jekyll Version:** 4.3.x
*   **Result:** Success.
